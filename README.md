# Harvest Natural Language Time Entry MCP Server

An MCP server that lets you log Harvest time entries using natural language, including special handling for leave requests. This server makes time tracking more intuitive by understanding natural language inputs and automatically handling common scenarios like leave requests.

## Features

- üó£Ô∏è Natural language time entry parsing
- üèñÔ∏è Special leave request handling (e.g., "I'm off sick today")
- ‚è∞ Configurable work day hours
- üåç Timezone support
- üéØ Automatic project and task matching
- üìÖ Smart date parsing (today, yesterday, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- A Harvest account
- Personal access token from [Harvest Developer Tools](https://id.getharvest.com/developers)
- Account ID (shown on the same page as your token)

## Installation

### Installation

1. Install the [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/desktop)

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrian-dotco/harvest-mcp-server.git
cd harvest-mcp-server
```

3. Install dependencies and build:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

4. Run the setup script:
```bash
node build/setup.js
```

If you are doing this in the Claude CLI, you can copy the info into your `~/.claude.json` file.

5. Follow the prompts to enter your:
   - Harvest Personal Access Token (from https://id.getharvest.com/developers)
   - Harvest Account ID
   - Standard work day hours (default: 7.5)
   - Timezone (default: Australia/Perth)

6. Restart Claude desktop app

That's it! You can now use natural language time tracking in Claude.


### Staying Updated

To update to the latest version:
```bash
git pull
npm install
npm run build
```

The setup script will have configured Claude to use your local build of the server, so any updates you pull will be automatically available after rebuilding.
